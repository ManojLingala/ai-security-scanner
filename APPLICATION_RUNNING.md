### 🚀 Next Steps for Full Deployment

To get the application fully operational, you would need to:

1. **Set up RavenDB Database**
   - Create the database: `AISecurityScanner-Dev`
   - Verify RavenDB is accessible at http://localhost:8080

2. **Configure AI Provider API Keys**
   - Add your OpenAI API key to `appsettings.Development.json`
   - Add your Anthropic API key to `appsettings.Development.json`

3. **Test API Endpoints**
   - Access Swagger UI at http://localhost:5000/swagger
   - Test authentication endpoints
   - Create organizations and users
   - Test security scanning functionality

### 📋 Available API Endpoints

The application includes these controllers:
- **AuthController** - User authentication and JWT tokens
- **ScanController** - Security scan management
- **RepositoryController** - Repository management
- **TeamController** - Organization and user management (via base routing)
